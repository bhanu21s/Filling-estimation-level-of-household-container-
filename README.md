# Liquid Level Detector (Dynamic)		



## Prerequisites (Python)
- cv2
- math
- argparse
- imutils
- collections


# Methodology:

I practiced detecting liquid (especially transparent ones such as water) using a wide variety of avenues. This resulted in a series of vastly differing performance reports and findings. These methods included **Colour Tracking**, **Frame Change Detection**, **Gaussian Blur**, **Canny Edge Detection** and a combination of all.

## Colour Tracking (with range):

This method  involved specifying a range of values that openCV would then start tracking. This method is a commonly used one within the scope of openCV methodologies.

## Frame Change Detection:	

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.

## Results & Analysis:
The latest version of this program runs at a very high efficiency rate, being able to accurately determine the water depth using a live video feed.
